# Geodesic Structure Raised Vegetable Garden Project

## Overview
The Geodesic Structure Raised Vegetable Garden Project is an innovative approach to sustainable gardening. By combining the strength and efficiency of geodesic domes with modern automation systems, this project aims to create a durable, self-sustaining structure for growing vegetables while monitoring and diagnosing environmental conditions.

## What is a Geodesic Dome?
A geodesic dome is a spherical structure composed of a network of triangles that distribute stress evenly across the structure. This design is renowned for its:
- **Strength**: Geodesic domes can withstand heavy loads and harsh weather conditions.
- **Efficiency**: Minimal materials are required for construction while maximizing interior space.
- **Versatility**: Suitable for various applications, including greenhouses, homes, and storage.

### Why Use a Geodesic Dome for Gardening?
The geodesic dome provides an ideal environment for gardening:
- Protection against extreme weather (wind, rain, snow, and heat).
- Optimal light distribution for plant growth.
- Space efficiency for raised garden beds and vertical gardening.

## Project Goals
1. **Build a Geodesic Dome**: Construct a geodesic dome as a raised vegetable garden using the blueprint provided.
2. **Automate with Arduino and ESP32**: Integrate an automation system for monitoring and controlling environmental conditions.
3. **Enhance Sustainability**: Utilize modern technology to improve productivity and reduce manual labor.

## Blueprint
For the structural design, please refer to the **[UnityDome Basic Blueprint](https://wangerflange.com/downloads/unitydome_basic.pdf)**. This document provides a detailed guide for constructing the geodesic dome, including measurements and assembly instructions.

## Automation System
The automation system will include:
- **Arduino and ESP32**: These microcontrollers will handle sensor data processing and control mechanisms.
- **Sensors**:
  - **Temperature and Humidity Sensors**: Monitor the microclimate inside the dome.
  - **Soil Moisture Sensors**: Diagnose soil conditions to ensure proper irrigation.
  - **Light Sensors**: Track light levels for optimal plant growth.
- **Actuators**:
  - Automated irrigation system.
  - Ventilation control for temperature regulation.
  - Lighting system for supplemental light.

## Features
- **Environment Monitoring**: Real-time diagnostics of temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light levels.
- **Automated Actions**: Intelligent control of irrigation, ventilation, and lighting based on sensor data.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Connect to the system via Wi-Fi for remote access and monitoring.

## How to Build
1. **Construct the Geodesic Dome**:
   - Use the [UnityDome Basic Blueprint](https://wangerflange.com/downloads/unitydome_basic.pdf) to assemble the structure.
   - Ensure the structure is stable and properly secured to the ground.
2. **Set Up Raised Garden Beds**:
   - Install raised garden beds inside the dome for efficient planting and water drainage.
3. **Install Sensors and Automation System**:
   - Connect sensors to the Arduino/ESP32 microcontrollers.
   - Program the system to automate irrigation, ventilation, and lighting.
4. **Test and Optimize**:
   - Calibrate sensors and test the system to ensure proper functionality.
   - Adjust settings for optimal plant growth.

## Benefits
- **Sustainability**: Reduce water and energy usage with automated systems.
- **Convenience**: Minimize manual labor with smart gardening technology.
- **Scalability**: Adapt the system for different sizes and types of gardens.

## Future Work
- Expand sensor capabilities to include pH and nutrient monitoring.
- Integrate solar panels for a fully sustainable power supply.
- Develop a mobile app for enhanced remote control and monitoring.
