### Integration with Sensors and ESP32/Arduino
1. **Sensors to Include**:
   - Soil moisture sensors.
   - Temperature and humidity sensors (e.g., DHT22).
   - Light intensity sensors (e.g., BH1750).
   - Water level sensors for irrigation systems.

2. **Microcontroller Usage**:
   - **ESP32**:
     - Handle Wi-Fi connectivity for remote data monitoring via MQTT or HTTP.
     - Host a lightweight web server for real-time data visualization.
   - **Arduino**:
     - Collect sensor data and communicate with ESP32 via I2C or UART.

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Add automated irrigation systems using relays and water pumps.
   - Integrate solar panels for sustainable power generation.
   - Use a geodesic dome for controlled environmental factors (e.g., temperature regulation).

4. **Software Features**:
   - Dashboard to monitor real-time sensor data and control irrigation.
   - Historical data logging and analytics.
   - Notifications for low soil moisture or sensor errors.

### Next Steps
1. **Define Scope**:
   - Clarify which sensors and hardware modules to use.
   - Confirm if this will support advanced features like automated irrigation or solar power.

2. **Create a Repository Structure**:
   - Set up the folder structure outlined above.
   - Initialize with boilerplate Arduino/ESP32 sketches and placeholder files.

3. **Collaborate with Makerspace Community**:
   - Invite contributions from makers for hardware design, firmware, and software development.

4. **Documentation and Tutorials**:
   - Document each step in the setup process to make the project accessible to beginners.
