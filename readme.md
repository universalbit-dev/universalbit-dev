## Software Architecture Patterns
This repository adopts various software architecture patterns to enhance modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Some notable patterns include:
1. **Layered Architecture**:
   - Projects like **ANN** and **ESP8266** utilize layered designs, separating hardware interfacing, communication protocols, and logic layers.
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - The **Blockchain** and **Gekko M4** sub-projects utilize event-driven principles to react to real-time data changes.
3. **Microservices and Modular Design**:
   - Projects such as **HA Cluster** and **CNCjs** are designed to function as independent modules, making them reusable and flexible.
4. **Client-Server Architecture**:
   - IoT-related projects like **ESP8266 NTP Server** implement client-server communication models.

## Disambiguation
The **UniversalBit Dev** repository covers a wide range of projects and technologies. If you encounter any confusion or need clarification about specific terms, sub-projects, or concepts, please refer to:
- [Disambiguation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Disambiguation)
- The documentation within each sub-project directory.

Feel free to open an issue or discussion in the repository for further clarification.

- **Advantages**

Efficient way to share large amounts of data
A subsystem does not have to worry about how data is produced or used by other subsystems.
Centralized management of backup, security, access control, and error recovery.
Easy to add new subsystems.

- **Disadvantages**

Systems must agree on a compromise data model, which could negatively impact performance.
Adopting a new data model becomes difficult and costly: the entire repository must be modified and all subsystems must be updated.
Centralizing backup and security does not address the specific requirements of certain subsystems.
It is difficult to efficiently distribute the repository across multiple separate machines while still viewing it as logically centralized. This would create redundancy and data consistency issues.
