This skeleton provides a blueprint for creating **scalable** and **modular** microarchitecture apps in Node.js. Each application is treated as an **independent package** with its own codebase, dependencies, and purpose. Shared resources and configurations are centralized to promote **reusability** and **maintainability**.

#### **Key Principles**
1. **Modularity**: Each app is self-contained and serves a specific purpose.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Shared utilities and configurations.
3. **Scalability**: The structure supports adding or removing apps seamlessly.
4. **Docker Integration**: Each app can be containerized and managed independently.

---

### **Folder-by-Folder Explanation**

#### **1. Apps**
This directory contains all the independent  apps. Each app is a standalone Node.js project with its own `package.json` and codebase.

- **unbt-microarchitecture/**:  
   A foundational unbt-microarchitecture that showcases how to structure a Node.js app.  
   - **src/controllers/**: Contains logic for handling requests and managing responses.
   - **src/models/**: Defines the database models and schemas.
   - **src/routes/**: API routes/endpoints specific to this app.
   - **src/utils/**: Utility functions specific to the app (e.g., helpers, formatters).
   - **src/events/**: Implements Node.js events for asynchronous communication.
   - **app.js**: The main entry point of the application that initializes middleware, routes, etc.
   - **server.js**: The file that starts the Express server.

- **cryptocurrency/**:  
   Includes apps related to cryptocurrency projects, such as `gekko-m4-globular-cluster`.

- **fabcity/**:  
   Contains apps for generating city-related data or simulations.

- **hacluster/**:  
   A directory for high-availability clusters, such as `harmadillium`.

- **blockchain/**:  
   Houses blockchain-specific services for Bitcoin, Litecoin and blockchain related project.

- **unbt-cdn/**:
   A CDN (Content Delivery Network) project based on the JsDelivr infrastructure.

---

#### **2. Shared Resources**

**Shared Configurations:** 
Eliminate redundant configuration logic by using a load-balanced resource pool for consistent access to databases, environment variables, and other shared settings.

**Event Bus:**
A mechanism for asynchronous communication that allows loosely coupled apps to interact without direct dependencies.

**Utilities:**
Common tools like logging and error handling are provided as distributed libraries to ensure consistency without enforcing centralization.

- **config/**:
  - `database.js`: Contains shared database configurations for all apps.
  - `env.js`: Manages environment variable utilities.

- **utils/**:
  - `logger.js`: A global logging utility for debugging and monitoring.
  - `errorHandler.js`: Handles errors globally to ensure consistency.

- **events/**:
  - `eventBus.js`: A shared event bus for inter-app communication.
  - `eventTypes.js`: Constants for event names/types to avoid duplication.

---

#### **3. API Gateway**
This serves as the central API gateway for routing and load balancing requests to various apps.

- **src/routes/**: Defines routes for forwarding requests to specific apps.
- **src/middlewares/**: Middleware functions for authentication, validation, etc.
- **app.js**: Initializes the API gateway's infrastructure.
- **server.js**: The entry point for starting the API gateway server.

---

#### **4. Docker Compose**
Contains Docker-related files for containerizing apps and managing them with Docker Compose.

- **docker-compose.yml**: Orchestrates all the Docker containers for the apps.
- **[app-name].Dockerfile**: Dockerfiles for building individual app containers (e.g., `unbt-microarchitecture.Dockerfile`).

---

#### **5. Root-Level Files**
- **.env**: Stores global environment variables for all apps (e.g., API keys, database URLs).
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to exclude from version control.
- **README.md**: Provides documentation for the entire project.
- **package.json**: Contains dependencies and scripts for the overall microarchitecture.

---

### **How to Use This Skeleton**
1. **Start with the `apps/` directory**:
   - Add new apps as independent packages. Each app should have its own `package.json` and follow the structure in `unbt-microarchitecture`.

2. **Leverage the `shared/` directory**:
   - Use shared resources like `utils/logger.js` or `config/database.js` to avoid duplication.

3. **Centralize API management with `api-gateway/`**:
   - Use this as the single entry point for all client requests. Route requests to the appropriate apps.

4. **Containerize the Apps**:
   - Use the `docker/` directory to containerize and deploy apps individually or as a group.

---

### **Notes**
1. The term "microarchitecture" refers to the global framework and design principles, while "apps" implement the actual functionality or microservices.
2. By maintaining this distinction, the structure ensures both scalability (through independent apps) and consistency (through shared resources).
3. This structure is designed for teams and projects that aim to build scalable and maintainable systems. By following this skeleton, you can ensure consistency, modularity, and reusability across your apps.
