The `json/easyparser/easyparser.js` file is a utility for parsing PDF files into JSON format using the `pdf2json` package. Here are the key points:

1. **Purpose**:
   - Converts PDF files from binary to JSON format.
   - Utilizes `pdf2json` for the conversion.
   - Useful for projects like JsonBin.io that handle JSON data without database setup or maintenance.

2. **Code Explanation**:
   - Imports necessary modules: `fs` and `pdf2json`.
   - Initializes a `PDFParser` object.
   - Handles PDF parsing errors by logging them.
   - Converts parsed PDF data to JSON and writes it to `amicizia.json`.
   - Loads and parses `amicizia.pdf` from the `pdf` directory.
   - Reads the PDF file buffer and parses it if no errors occur.
