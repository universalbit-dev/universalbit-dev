The `convnet.js` file is a part of a library for creating and training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in JavaScript. Here are the main components:

1. **Utility Functions**: Functions for generating random numbers, creating zero arrays, and other array utilities.
2. **Volume Class (`Vol`)**: Represents a 3D volume of numbers, which is the core data structure for holding data, weights, and gradients.
3. **Layers**: Various types of layers such as convolutional layers, fully connected layers, pooling layers, normalization layers, activation layers (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh), and dropout layers.
4. **Network Class (`Net`)**: Manages a sequence of layers and handles forward and backward propagation through the network.
5. **Trainer Class (`Trainer`)**: Implements different training algorithms (SGD, Adagrad, Adadelta) to train the network.

For further details and usage, you can explore the actual [convnet.js file](https://github.com/universalbit-dev/universalbit-dev/blob/main/convolutional_neural_network/convnet.js).

The `deepqlearn.js` file is part of a reinforcement learning library that utilizes Deep Q-Learning (DQN). Here are the main components:

1. **Experience Class**: Stores the state, action, reward, and next state for each interaction.
2. **Brain Class**: Implements the core DQN algorithm. It manages the neural network, experience replay, and the epsilon-greedy policy for action selection.
3. **Network and Trainer**: Uses `convnetjs` library to create and train the neural network. The network predicts the value of actions given a state.
4. **Temporal Difference Learning**: The agent learns from past experiences stored in a replay memory, using a Temporal Difference (TD) learning approach.
