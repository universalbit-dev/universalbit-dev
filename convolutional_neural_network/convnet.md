# Convolutional Neural Network Implementation (`convnet.js`)

This document outlines the features and implementation details of the `convnet.js` file, which is part of the `convnetjs` library. Understanding this file will help developers contribute more effectively.

## Features and Highlights

### 1. Random Number Utilities
- **Methods**:
  - `gaussRandom`: Generates Gaussian-distributed random numbers.
  - `randf`: Generates a random floating-point number within a range.
  - `randi`: Generates a random integer within a range.
  - `randn`: Generates a random number with a given mean and standard deviation.

### 2. Array Utilities
- **Methods**:
  - `zeros`: Creates an array filled with zeros.
  - `arrContains`: Checks if an element exists in an array.
  - `arrUnique`: Returns an array with unique elements.

### 3. Volume (`Vol`) Class
- **Purpose**:
  - Represents a 3D volume of numbers used for data storage and manipulation in neural networks.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `get`, `set`, and `add`: Access and modify elements in the volume.
  - `toJSON` and `fromJSON`: Serialize and deserialize the volume.

### 4. Layers
- **Types of Layers**:
  - **Convolutional Layer**: Implements spatial weight sharing for feature extraction.
  - **Fully Connected Layer**: Connects all neurons in one layer to every neuron in the next.
  - **Pooling Layer**: Reduces the spatial size of the representation to reduce computation.
  - **Activation Layers**: Includes ReLU, Sigmoid, Maxout, and Tanh activations.
  - **Dropout Layer**: Implements regularization to prevent overfitting.
  - **Softmax Layer**: Computes probabilities for classification tasks.

### 5. Network (`Net`) Class
- **Purpose**: 
  - Manages a sequence of layers for end-to-end neural network training.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `makeLayers`: Initializes layers based on definitions.
  - `forward` and `backward`: Performs forward propagation and backpropagation.

### 6. Trainer (`Trainer`) Class
- **Purpose**: 
  - Implements optimization algorithms for training the network.
- **Supported Methods**:
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, and more.

## Contribution Opportunities
