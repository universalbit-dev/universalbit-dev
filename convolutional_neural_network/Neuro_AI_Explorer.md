# Neuro-AI Explorer

## Bridging Natural & Artificial Environments

This project introduces a conceptual framework for collaborative learning and system modeling, connecting natural and artificial environments within the Neuro-AI Explorer platform.

### 🧩 Entities

- 🌍 **Spheres:**  
  Represent natural environments and biological concepts—such as neuron counts in various animal species (see [animals_by_number_of_neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_number_of_neurons)).  
  Each sphere is color-coded to correspond with a specific domain (e.g., Nature, Environment, Social) and may be interconnected to reflect relationships within the natural world.

- 🤖 **Squares:**  
  Represent artificial (neural network) environments and key AI concepts—such as **neuron**, **layers**, **adadelta**—adapted from modern neural network architectures and inspired by resources like the [Stanford CS221: Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/afshinea/stanford-cs-221-artificial-intelligence) course.  
  Each square is color-coded to its function or architectural role, and squares may also be interconnected to reflect modularity and collaboration in AI systems.

### 🔗 Connections

- **Bidirectional Networking:**  
  - Spheres (biological) and squares (artificial) connect and communicate using both synchronous and asynchronous methods.
  - This enables integrated exploration, side-by-side comparisons, and analogies between real-world neuron data and artificial neural network structures.

| Space        | ●                | ■                    | Cosmos, Structure                   |

**Legend:**  
● = Sphere (Natural domain)  
■ = Square (Artificial/Neuralnet domain)
